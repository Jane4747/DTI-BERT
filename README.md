# DTI-BERT
A tool for identifying the drug-target interaction in cellular networking.
The original website: https://bioinfo.jcu.edu.cn/dtibert  is under maintenance. We are therefore resubmitting a new website: http://121.36.221.79/dtibert/, so sorry for the inconvenience caused.
The “DTI-BERT” predictor has four modules  feature engineering, feature extraction, optimization, and decision-making.

About feature engineering module.
Feature extraction from protein is showed in “Protein- BERT_Mean(example).ipynb”, feature extraction from drug molecule is showed in “drug-FP2-DWT.ipynb”.

About feature extraction, optimization, and decision-making modules.
An example of our predictor is showed in “DTI-BERT example.ipynb”.

Addition.
The code referred in section “Comparison of several classic protein and drug feature extraction methods” is packed in “DTI-BERTL.rar”.
